ðŸ›’ Zepto E-Commerce SQL Analytics Project

This project is a real-world data analytics portfolio project built using PostgreSQL on an e-commerce dataset from Zepto, one of Indiaâ€™s fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. The goal of this project is to go beyond simple SQL practice and demonstrate how a data analyst works end-to-end with raw retail data â€” from importing and cleaning to generating insights that drive business decisions.

The project begins with data import and setup, where raw e-commerce inventory data is structured into a PostgreSQL database. Since the dataset is messy, the first step involves data exploration to understand its characteristics â€” checking row counts, identifying missing values, duplicates, and unusual values in categories.

Next, I perform data cleaning to make the dataset analysis-ready. This includes handling missing and invalid records, fixing incorrect product prices (such as zero values), and converting pricing from paise to rupees. These steps reflect common real-world data challenges that analysts face in organizations.

Once the data is cleaned, I move into exploratory data analysis (EDA) and business-focused queries. Using SQL, I analyze revenue trends, stock availability, discount patterns, and product categories. I also perform product segmentation to identify high-revenue categories, fast-moving inventory, and products that are frequently out of stock.

The project highlights not only technical SQL skills but also the ability to think analytically and answer meaningful business questions such as:

What is the total revenue generated after discounts?

Which product categories drive the most sales?

How much stock is underutilized or overstocked?

Which items frequently go out of stock and may impact customer satisfaction?

This project is designed for anyone preparing for data analyst roles. It demonstrates proficiency in SQL, problem-solving, and working with messy datasets that reflect real-world scenarios. It is also an excellent portfolio project to showcase in interviews, as it blends technical skills with business context.

By the end of this project, I not only practiced SQL but also built an end-to-end case study that mimics how analysts at e-commerce companies generate insights to support decision-making.
